Description
  Create a data structure that allows the user to (1) add integers and (2) report the median.

How to build/run
  When you run it with the IDLE of your choice, the code asks you a question, if you want to add numbers to the list or find the median of
  the list. If you choose the first one then you add the number of your choice, until you decide to put median an get the median of the list 
  you already gave.
